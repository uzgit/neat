# NEAT Neural Networks

This repository contains a feed-forward implementation of the NEAT (Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. It also contains methods for visualizing the networks. This is based on the [python-neat](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python) code.

Nodes are labeled with node identifiers. The dotted edges are disabled, solid edges are enabled. Edges are labeled with weights.
